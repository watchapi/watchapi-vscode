## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

-   Use TypeScript strict mode
-   Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
-   Use arrow functions for callbacks
-   Use async/await over promises when possible
-   Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Organization

```
src/
├── extension.ts           # Extension entry point
├── commands/              # Command implementations
├── parsers/              # Framework-specific parsers
├── providers/            # Tree data providers
├── services/             # Business logic
├── storage/              # Data persistence
├── ui/                   # UI components (webviews)
└── utils/                # Shared utilities
```

### Naming Conventions

-   **Files**: `kebab-case.ts`
-   **Classes**: `PascalCase`
-   **Functions/Variables**: `camelCase`
-   **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
-   **Interfaces**: `PascalCase` (no `I` prefix)
-   **Types**: `PascalCase`

### Code Quality

-   Run `pnpm run lint` before committing
-   Run `pnpm run check-types` to verify TypeScript
-   Write self-documenting code
-   Add comments for complex logic
-   Keep functions small and focused
