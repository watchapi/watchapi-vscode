# WatchAPI — API Client for Next.js & NestJS

WatchAPI lets you run and test your Next.js, NestJS, and tRPC APIs directly from your codebase - without Postman, manual setup, or context switching.

> One click → all your API routes become executable requests.

## ![WatchAPI](./assets/screenshot-import.png "Import APIs from Next.js or NestJS")

## Why WatchAPI

If you work with modern backend frameworks, you already have:

- Defined routes
- Typed handlers
- Local servers running

But to test APIs you still:

- Recreate requests manually
- Keep external tools in sync
- Switch context constantly

**WatchAPI removes that layer.**<br>
Your code is the source of truth.

## What It Does

- Bulk Import From Code<br>
  Automatically extract API endpoints from:
  - Next.js (App Router & Pages)
  - NestJS controllers
  - tRPC routers
- Executable Collections<br>
  Endpoints are grouped into collections you can run instantly.
- Inline Response Inspection<br>
  Inspect status codes, headers, and response bodies without leaving VS Code.
- Full HTTP Support<br>
  GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension
2. Open the WatchAPI activity view in VS Code
3. Import or create a collection
4. Execute requests and inspect responses
5. **(Optional)** Sign in to enable sync and collaboration

## Local-First by Design

- **Local by default**: <br>
  All collections and data stay on your machine.
- **Opt-in sync**: <br>
  Cloud sync is enabled only when you explicitly sign in.
- **No telemetry**: <br>
  The extension does not collect usage analytics.
