# WatchAPI Client

WatchAPI Client is an API client for organizing and testing REST and NestJS endpoints.

It extracts endpoints directly from a Next.js or NestJS codebase, structures them into collections, and lets you execute requests and inspect responses — without context switching.

> Bulk import API endpoints directly from your Next.js or NestJS codebase

## Features

- **Endpoint Collections**: Automatically group and organize discovered endpoints
- **HTTP Method Support**: Execute GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
- **Response Inspection**: Inspect status codes, headers, and response bodies inline
- **Bulk Import**: Sync endpoints from Next.js, NestJS, and tRPC projects in one click
- **Local-First by Default**: All data stored locally in VS Code
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Sync collections across devices and collaborate with teams
- **Multi-Organization Support**: Switch between organizations when logged in
- **Dashboard Access**: Open related endpoints in the WatchAPI dashboard (when logged in)
