# WatchAPI Client

WatchAPI Client is a REST client for testing and managing API endpoints directly from VS Code.

It lets you organize endpoints into collections, send HTTP requests, and work with APIs without leaving your editor.

## Features

- Create and manage API collections
- Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- View responses inside VS Code
- Designed to work with WatchAPI workflows

## Quick Started

1. Install the extension
2. Open the WatchAPI activity view
3. Create a collection and add endpoints
4. Send requests and inspect responses

## Privacy stuff

To provide cloud-synced collections, the extension automatically creates a temporary guest account.

- A guest account is created on first use
- API collections and endpoints are stored securely in the WatchAPI cloud
- Guest accounts are retained for up to 30 days
- No personal information is collected beyond technical identifiers needed to operate the service

You can review the full Privacy Policy at https://watchapi.dev/privacy
